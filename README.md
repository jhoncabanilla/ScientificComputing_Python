## Web Services
The two most common ways to send data over the Internet are: JSON and XML.

### XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
- Primary purpose is to help information systems share structured data.
- **Tags** indicate the beginning and ending of elements.
- **Attributes** - Keyword/value pairs on the opening tag of XML.
- **Serialize / De-Serialize** - Convert data in one program into a common format that can be stored and/or transmitted between systems in a programming language-independet manner.

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
- JSON represents data as nested "lists" and "dictionaries"

### API (Applicaton Program Interface)
- The API itself is largely abstract in that it specifies an interface and controls the behavior of the objects specified in that interface. The software that provides the funcionality described by an API is said to be an 'implementation' of the API. An API is typically defined in terms of the programming language used to build an application.
